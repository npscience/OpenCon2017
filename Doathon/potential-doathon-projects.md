### OAbot

**Lead: Jake Orlowitz** <-- he'll be in the room

**Non-coders**

"The idea is simple: go to the web app OAbot, review a citation with a closed access (paywalled) link, check the suggested open citation, and add the open link to the citation if it's a good fit.

This makes every citation on Wikipedia easier to access, read, and verify!

I'd love it if you would try out http://oabot.org.
