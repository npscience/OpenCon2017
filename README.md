# OpenCon2017

This repo is to collate useful resources for me to make the most of OpenCon

**Do you have an idea for how we can improve the way research is communicated, that could help it to become more transparent, reproducible, and collaborative?** I'd like to hear it! I'm Innovation Officer at eLife, and we are looking for ideas/projects like yours. We are committed to supporting open source developments, and can help you to showcase your idea (see [eLifeLabs](https://elifesciences.org/labs)), and maybe more.

Find me in person. Tweet/DM @npscience. Email: innovation [at] elifesciences.org.

**Are you an early career researcher in the life sciences?** Talk to me about becoming an eLife ambassador and/or about the initiatives eLife has to help you to do your research.

Also, you could connect with current members of the eLife Early-Career Advisory Group at OpenCon: Vinodh Ilongavan and Laurent Gatto will both be there.

**Are you an open-source developer?** We sometimes have vacancies at eLife

We are looking for a lead developer in Node.js, React, AWS to work on the development, automation, monitoring, architecture and testing of an open source system we are co-developing with other non-profits and publishers. [Vacancy info](https://elifesciences.org/jobs/7b0b2979/lead-developer-node-js-react-aws-open-source)

We also like to know who you are so we can invite you to cool events to work on open source projects for open science. Want to be in the loop? Follow @eLifeInnovation on twitter, or connect with me personally / by email.


## Useful resources

There are lots of great projects that could benefit from contributions during the [doathon](http://doathon.opencon2017.org/). I'm compiling [a list](https://github.com/npscience/OpenCon2017/blob/master/Doathon/potential-doathon-projects.md). Contributions welcome.
